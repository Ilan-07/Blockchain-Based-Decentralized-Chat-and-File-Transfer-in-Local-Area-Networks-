# 🧩 Blockchain-Based LAN Chat — Secured Interactive Version

### 🚀 Overview
This project implements a **fully interactive, secure, and decentralized LAN chat application** built on **blockchain principles**.  
Each message or file transfer is recorded as a **block**, ensuring **tamper-proof communication** and **transparent synchronization** among all peers in the local network.

---

### 🛡️ Key Features
- **Blockchain Backbone:** Every message is stored as a verifiable block.  
- **Peer Synchronization:** Automatic request/response protocol ensures full chain consistency across all connected peers.  
- **Tamper Detection:** Detects and broadcasts file or block modifications with live alerts.  
- **Real-Time Metrics:** Graphical analysis of latency, throughput, and packet loss.  
- **Blockchain Visualizer:** Interactive view of the chain, with block-level details.  
- **Cross-Platform Notifications:** Desktop alerts for incoming messages or tamper events.  
- **Persistent Peer Colors:** Each node is color-coded for easy identification.  
- **Enhanced Security:**  
  - Thread-safe blockchain access  
  - Input sanitization  
  - Path traversal prevention  
  - Rate-limiting and message size checks  
  - Bounded memory usage

### 🧰 Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install customtkinter matplotlib networkx plyer win10toast
```

> 💡 Note: Some dependencies (like `win10toast`) are optional and used only for Windows notifications.

---

### ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bccc.git
   cd bccc
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python3 bccc.py
   ```

3. Launch the application on **multiple computers** connected to the same **LAN network**.  
   Each instance will auto-detect peers, sync blockchain data, and display a visual dashboard.

## 📖 Step-by-Step User Manual

### 🪜 1. Setup and Launch
1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed (`python --version`).
2. Install required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter matplotlib networkx plyer win10toast
   ```
3. Place the `bccc.py` file and any supporting files in a single folder.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
5. Start the program:
   ```bash
   python3 bccc.py
   ```
6. Repeat the same steps on **all other systems** connected to the same LAN.

---

### 💬 2. Sending Messages
- Type your message in the **Chat Input Box** at the bottom of the window.  
- Press **Enter** or click **Send**.  
- The message is added as a **new block** and broadcast to all peers.  
- Other peers will see your message instantly — synchronized through the blockchain.

---

### 📁 3. File Transfer
- Click the **Attach / Upload** button (if available) to select a file.
- The selected file will be converted into a block and shared with all peers.
- The blockchain records the transfer to ensure integrity and traceability.
- All peers can view or download the file from the shared ledger.

---

### 🔍 4. Viewing the Blockchain
- Open the **Blockchain Visualizer** tab in the interface.
- Each block represents a message or file event.
- Click on a block to view:
  - Sender information  
  - Timestamp  
  - Hash and previous hash values  
  - Data integrity status  

---

### ⚙️ 5. Monitoring Performance
- The **Performance Graph** shows:
  - **Latency:** round-trip time between peers.
  - **Throughput:** rate of data transfer.
  - **Packet Loss:** any message drops or network delays.
- These metrics update in real-time while chatting or transferring files.

---

### 🚨 6. Tamper Detection
- If a peer modifies or deletes a block:
  - The system immediately detects the mismatch.
  - All peers receive a **Tamper Alert** popup and notification.
  - The affected block is quarantined or marked invalid.
- You can view alerts in the blockchain visualizer.

---

### 🎨 7. Color-Coded Peers
- Each peer (device) is assigned a **unique color** for clarity in the UI.
- The color mapping persists between sessions using a local JSON file (`peer_colors.json`).

---

### 🧱 8. Quitting Safely
- To exit the program:
  - Close the window, or  
  - Use **Ctrl + C** in the terminal.
- The program automatically closes sockets and saves blockchain state.

---

### 🧠 9. Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Peers not visible | Devices not on same network | Check LAN/Wi-Fi connection |
| No messages appearing | Firewall blocking ports | Allow Python in firewall |
| Visualizer not updating | Matplotlib animation paused | Restart the app |
| Tamper alert triggered unexpectedly | Manual modification or sync delay | Wait for auto-sync or restart all peers |

---

### 🧩 10. Best Practices
- Run the app on a **stable LAN** with good connectivity.
- Avoid renaming or deleting blockchain files while running.
- Keep all peers on the **same version** of the application.
- For testing, run multiple terminal windows on a single machine with different ports.
